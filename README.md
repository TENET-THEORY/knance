# knance

## Overview

- I've personally been using this project to track my investments across different accounts 
  - It supports importing data from IBKR and Schwab
- The only example I could find that sharing code between Ktor and Next.js
  - Inspired by https://github.com/Kotlin/kmp-fullstack-conference-cms
- Some code has been generated by AI primarily the frontend code but is getting cleaned up

## Getting started

- Since this uses the Alpha Vantage bulk quote API, you will need a premium API key.
- This project also uses Open AI to distinguish between different etf types. So you will need to set an Open AI API key.
- You will need to create a database to connect to with the tables shown in the mapping file
- After the keys and database are set up, you can start the project using the commands in the package.json file
